  ðŸ›¸ **Space Invaders** is one of the first *classic arcade-style* shooter game first introduced in 1978 where you control a spaceship and defend Earth from waves of alien invaders. Dodge enemy fire, shoot them down, and survive as long as you can. It's fast-paced, fun, and full of retro vibes!
  The game features a realâ€‘time battle where your spaceship shoots down waves of descending aliens before they reach the bottom.
